# Tontine Smart Contract
This is a smart contract version of the tontine concept


# The tontine
A Tontine is a financial concept used in developing countries. It's a peer to peer saving system where each member of the circle puts in the same mount of money regularly in
a common pot. The full amount of the pot is paid successively to each circle member.

# The smart contract
This is a simple blockchain smart contract imitating the tontine concept. Everything is contained in the tontine.sol file. 
Every one can create a tontine others can subscribe to it and choose a rank to be paid. The pot payout is done automatically after each member makes the payment for a given round.
